# ü©∫ GenAI Healthcare Assistant (NHS Q&A Prototype)

A fast, accurate, and hallucination-resistant **GenAI assistant** built with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer health-related questions using official NHS documents. The assistant uses **semantic chunking**, **FAISS vector search**, and **OpenAI's GPT-4o**, with guardrails to ensure context-grounded answers.

## üöÄ Features

- üîé **Semantic Search with OpenAI Embeddings** (`text-embedding-3-small`)
- ü§ñ **Answer Generation using GPT-4o**, grounded in retrieved NHS content
- üß± **FAISS Vectorstore** for fast, scalable retrieval
- üìÑ **PDF Loader + Chunker** using LangChain tools
- üß† **Conversational Memory** with context-aware responses
- üîê **Topic Filtering + Safety Guardrails**
  - ‚úÖ Allowed: asthma, eczema, back pain, migraine, type 2 diabetes
  - üö´ Blocked: cancer, depression, thyroid, etc.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **FastAPI + HTML Interface** for local and production deployment
- üìö Answers cite source documents and include disclaimers

## üß™ How to Run

1. Clone the repo
2. Place your NHS PDFs in the `/data` folder
3. Set your OpenAI API key in a `.env` file:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```
4. Run the embedding + vectorstore builder:
   ```bash
   python src/embed_docs.py  # (if created separately)
   ```
5. Start the FastAPI app:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```
